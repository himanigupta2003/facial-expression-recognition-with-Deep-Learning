# facial-expression recognition-with-Deep-Learning
Deep learning is a newly-emerged machine learning theory, and has received extensive attentions in pattern recognition, signal processing, computer vision, etc. Deep belief networks (DBNs) is a representative method of deep learning and has a strong ability of unsupervised feature learning. by combining DBNs with multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a new method of facial expression recognition based on deep learning is proposed. The proposed method integrates the DBNs's advantage of unsupervised feature learning with the MLP's classification advantage. Experimental results on two benchmarking facial expression databases, i.e., the JAFFE database and the Cohn-Kanade database, demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method for facial expression recognition, outperforming the other state-of-the-art classification methods such as the nearest neighbour, MLP, support vector machine, the nearest subspace, as well as sparse representation-based classification.

# facial-expression
Our face is an intricate, highly differentiated part of our body – in fact, it is one of the most complex signal systems available to us. It includes over 40 structurally and functionally autonomous muscles, each of which can be triggered independently of each other.

The facial muscular system is the only place in our body where muscles are either attached to a bone and facial tissue (other muscles in the human body connect to two bones), or to facial tissue only such as the muscle surrounding the eyes or lips.

# Classify the emotions
Facial expressions are only one out of many correlates of emotion, but they might be the most apparent ones. Humans are obviously able to produce thousands of slightly varying sets of facial expressions – however, there is only a small set of distinctive facial configurations that almost every one associates with certain emotions, irrespective of gender, age, cultural background and socialization history.
