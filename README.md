# facial-expression recognition-with-Deep-Learning
Implemented a face detection modelusing Detectron2and several differentmachine learning algorithms such ask-nearest neighbors (”KNN”), multi-layer perceptron (”MLP”),convolutional neural net (”CNN”)for the facial expression recognition.

Tech used:Python, OpenCV, ML Techniques

# facial-expression
Our face is an intricate, highly differentiated part of our body – in fact, it is one of the most complex signal systems available to us. It includes over 40 structurally and functionally autonomous muscles, each of which can be triggered independently of each other.

The facial muscular system is the only place in our body where muscles are either attached to a bone and facial tissue (other muscles in the human body connect to two bones), or to facial tissue only such as the muscle surrounding the eyes or lips.

# Can you classify emotions?
Facial expressions are only one out of many correlates of emotion, but they might be the most apparent ones. Humans are obviously able to produce thousands of slightly varying sets of facial expressions – however, there is only a small set of distinctive facial configurations that almost every one associates with certain emotions, irrespective of gender, age, cultural background and socialization history.

These categorical emotions are:

ekmans basic emotions

The finding that almost everyone can produce and recognize the associated facial expressions of these emotions has led some researchers to the (debated!) assumption that they are universal.
